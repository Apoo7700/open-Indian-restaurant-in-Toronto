Success of a resturant depends on many factors, to name a few - location, competition and quality of the food.\nThis project tries to find an optimal recomendation for opening an Indian resturant in Toronto by taking all the above mentioned factors in\nconsideration.\nFoursquare API has been used to determine the optimal location to open an Indian Restaurant. For Indian Restaurant specifically, location and competition are both considered while providing a recomendation. If there are too many Indian Restaurants in the local vicinity, the profitability of the restaurant may severily decrease. Additionally, opening a restaurant in a higher income location would increase the profitability of the business compared to opening the resturant in a poor income locality."
